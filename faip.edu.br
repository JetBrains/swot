Dear JetBrains Team,

My name is Lucas Dmg, and I am a student at FAIP (Faculdade de Ensino Superior do Interior Paulista). I am writing to request the inclusion of our institution in the list of schools eligible to use JetBrains products.
School Information:

    School Name: FAIP
    Main Domain: faip.edu.br
    Second Domain: aluno.faip.edu.br
    Third Domain: professor.faip.edu.br

We believe that including our school in the list will allow our students and faculty to access the valuable resources offered by JetBrains products, thereby enhancing our learning and development in programming and technology.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your response.
